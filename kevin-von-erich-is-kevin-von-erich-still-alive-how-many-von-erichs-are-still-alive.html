Struggling to emulate his brothers’ success, he tragically ended his life in 1991.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Von Erich Daughters in Wrestling</strong></h2><p>While the male members of the Von Erich family predominantly dominated the wrestling narrative, the family’s wrestling legacy saw a resurgence through Kevin Von Erich’s and Kerry’s daughters.
