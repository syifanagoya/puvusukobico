"The Deuce." Michael Gandolfini has a net worth of $15 million. He is the son of the late actor James Gandolfini, who was best known for playing mobster Tony Soprano on the HBO crime series "The Sopranos." In 2021, Michael Gandolfini played a younger version of his father's role in the film "The Many Saints of Newark," a prequel to "The Sopranos."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Michael Gandolfini was born on May 10, 1999 to James Gandolfini and Marcy Wudarski. He is of Italian ancestry on his father's side. As a child, Gandolfini liked to perform; however, his father urged him away from an acting career, preferring that he pursue sports or directing. While in Rome with his family in June of 2013, Gandolfini found his father lying unconscious on the bathroom floor of their hotel. His father was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead from a heart attack.</p><h2 id=james-gandolfini8217s-estate><strong>James Gandolfini's Estate</strong></h2><p>At the time of his death, <a href=#>James Gandolfini's net worth</a> was $70 million. Roughly half of his estate's value was reportedly set aside to pay taxes.</p><p>James was survived by his second wife, <a href=# title="Deborah Lin Net Worth">Deborah Lin</a> and two children. He had a 13-year-old son named Michael Gandolfini from his first marriage and an eight month old daughter named Liliana from his marriage to Deborah. He left behind a rather interesting and complex will.</p><p>According to the will he signed two months after the birth of Liliana, Liliana and Deborah would each inherit 20% of his estate upon his death. The remaining 60% of his estate was divided in equal parts amongst his two sisters. Note that Michael Gandolfini was NOT left a share of this portion of James' estate.</p><p>James did not accidentally leave Michael out. As he stated in the will:</p><p>"<strong>I have in mind my beloved son Michaelâ€¦ I have made other provisions for him.</strong>"</p><p>Those "other provisions" started with a life insurance trust fund that was worth $7 million in 2013. The trust fund was created as a condition of his 2002 divorce from first wife Marcella Wudarski. Michael also inherited all of his fathers clothing and jewelry.</p><p>Michael and Liliana each received 50% of a property in Manhattan and land in Italy. In his will James stated:</p><p>"<strong>It is my hope and desire that they will continue to own said property and keep it in our family as long as possible</strong>."</p><p>Michael also had the right of first refusal on the Manhattan property.</p><p>James set aside $500,000 for each of his two nieces and $100-200,000 to half dozen friends.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-323951 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Michael-Gandolfini.jpg alt="Michael Gandolfini Net Worth" width=900 height=1350 sizes="(max-width: 1667px) 100vw, 1667px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-323951 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by David Livingston/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=start-acting-career><strong>Start of Acting Career</strong></h2><p>Gandolfini decided to pursue an acting career following the passing of his father.
