Fox is a Canadian-American retired actor, comedian, author, film producer, and activist who has a net worth of $65 million. Michael J. Fox has enjoyed one of the most successful careers of any 80's-era star. He became a household name, and a heartthrob, appearing on the hit sitcom, "Family Ties". His status as a major star was cemented after he starred in the wildly successful, "Back to the Future" movie franchise.</p><p>In the mid-90s, he re-emerged as a sitcom darling, appearing on the successful series, "Spin City".&nbsp; The Canadian-born actor was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in the early 90s, and has since focused primarily on voice over work and writing work, as the symptoms associated with the disease began to affect his ability to do on-camera work. He also became a very busy and vocal activist with regards to Parkinson's research and treatment. The winner of five Emmy Awards, four Golden Globes, two SAG Awards, and a Grammy Award, Mr. Fox has been married to the same woman since 1988, and has four children. This is basically a family stability record by Hollywood standards.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Michael Andrew Fox was born in Edmonton, Alberta, on June 9, 1961. He is best known by his stage name Michael J. Fox. His mother, Phyllis (nÃ©e Piper) was an actress and payroll clerk, and his father, William Fox, was a police officer and Canadian Forces member. He is of English and Scottish descent. Due to his father's career, the family moved around a lot before finally settling in Burnaby, a suburb of Vancouver, when his father retired in 1971. Fox attended Burnaby Central Secondary School.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>He first entered the world of entertainment when he was fifteen years old. He starred in the Canadian television series "Leo and Me", produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The show was initially produced and filmed in 1976, but it did not air until 1981. It had a total of 12 episodes. He had his American television debut in the TV film "Letters from Frank" (1979). It was at this time, when he tried to register with the Screen Actors Guild, that he discovered that there was already an actor registered under the name Michael Fox. He did not like the sound of "Michael A. Fox", and he also did not like the names "Andrew" or "Andy", so instead he chose to adopt a new middle initial. He settled on "J." as a tribute to the actor <a href=# title="Michael J. Pollard Net Worth">Michael J. Pollard</a>.</p><h2 id=family-ties><strong>Family Ties</strong></h2><p>Fox's first feature film role was in the 1980 film "Midnight Madness", followed by the 1982 film "Class of 1984". Then, in 1982, he was cast as "Young Republican" Alex P. Keaton in the NBC show "Family Ties". The series aired for seven seasons, from 1982 to 1989. The original focus of the show was supposed to be the parents of the family, but after widespread positive reception of Fox's character, NBC made him the main character after the fourth episode. The show was extremely successful. At the height of its popularity, it drew one-third of American household in as viewers every week. For his performance on "Family Ties", Fox won three Emmy Awards (in 1986, 1987, and 1988) and a Golden Globe Award (in 1989).</p><h2 id=back-future><strong>Back to the Future</strong></h2><p>In January 1985, Fox was cast as Marty McFly in the time travel film "Back to the Future". The director <a href=# title="Robert Zemeckis Net Worth">Robert Zemeckis</a> wanted to cast Fox as Marty right from the beginning, but <a href=# title="Gary David Goldberg Net Worth">Gary David Goldberg</a>, the creator of "Family Ties", refused to allow Zemeckis to approach Fox because he needed Fox to carry the show in the absence of <a href=# title="Meredith Baxter Net Worth">Meredith Baxter</a>, who was on maternity leave at the time. Zemeckis cast <a href=# title="Eric Stoltz Net Worth">Eric Stoltz</a> as Marty instead, and began production on "Back to the Future", but eventually replaced Stoltz with Fox after Baxter returned to "Family Ties", which freed up Fox's schedule a little bit.</p><p>In order to work on both the film and the TV series at once, Fox had to endure a grueling schedule. He would rehearse for "Family Ties" from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. before going to the "Back to the Future" set to rehearse and shoot until 2:30 a.m. This schedule lasted for two months! His efforts were worth it, however, as "Back to the Future" was a huge commercial and critical success. It earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million, and spent eight consecutive weekends as the No. 1 movie at the US box office in 1985. Fox would later go on to star in the two successful sequels as well, "Back to the Future Part II" (1989) and "Back to the Future Part III" (1990).</p><h2 id=back-future-salaries><strong>Back to the Future Salaries</strong></h2><p>For the first "Back to the Future" movie, Michael J.
