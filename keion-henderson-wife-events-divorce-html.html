Parents&nbsp;to two daughters, the couple&nbsp;seldom&nbsp;shared details about their marriage, but Keion&nbsp;did showcase his wedded bliss&nbsp;on Instagram.</p><p>In a now deleted 2016 Instagram post, the pastor gushed about his wife, calling her&nbsp;a “timeless treasure” on&nbsp;her birthday. Along with that, there are also posts of birthday surprises&nbsp;that implied their marriage was going well. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Keion Henderson and his former wife Felicia Worked Together on Projects Related to Faith</h2><p>Apart from being his wife, Lady Felicia was also a partner in Keion’s professional life. The two worked together in the Lighthouse Church and also launched other projects, including the Sugarland Campus.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In September 2019, Keion told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>Chron</span></a><span>&nbsp;t</span>hat an African prophet had dreamt of Keion and his wife ministering in Sugarland, which eventually came true when the two of them jointly opened a Lighthouse Church branch. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In the same interview, Keion also shared how he and his wife led a church in Houston, Texas, together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Keion and his ex-wife Felecia have a daughter together</h2><p>The two exes co-parent their daughter <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Katelyn Henderson</a>&nbsp;together.

He was&nbsp;</span>encouraging&nbsp;others to accept love, but he himself was falling apart.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span>In an interview</span><span>&nbsp;with<span>&nbsp;</span>BlessedBeatz,</span>&nbsp;he shared&nbsp;<span>that he was&nbsp;learning&nbsp;</span>how to courageously move through that season — the season of separation — pastoring to a megachurch. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I was scared to death... [God] wasn’t wiping my tears.</p><p>Because he had&nbsp;been through his fair share of ups and downs, people found<span>&nbsp;</span>his words of wisdom transparent and relative.&nbsp;His life experiences have given him an insight into how to look past the hardship of one's&nbsp;current state and see the bigger picture. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In his book <span>The Shift,&nbsp;</span>the pastor focuses&nbsp;on transition periods between tough and better times.

She appreciates how he loves her and her children unconditionally. They have other posts of each other being adorable as well.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>It is known that the pair connected in 2019 when Shaunie attended one of Keion's conferences. In their recent podcast <a href=# rel="follow noopener">The Groow Zone</a>, Keion and his wife Shaunie touch upon how the pastor managed to impress her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As it turned out, Shaunie originally thought that it would be "boring" dating the pastor whom she met through a mutual friend in 2020. It was Keion who then invited her to watch him preach in San Bernardino, but instead, the pair connected at his hotel lobby in LA and ended up spending hours in a restaurant where they had gone for a bite,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“We had this great conversation that ended up being five or six hours to where we got kicked out of the regular restaurant into the lobby,” she revealed. After that, Shaunie invented a plan to test whether the pastor was judgemental by ordering two cocktails, but she said he passed it.&nbsp;</p><p>"I didn’t think that you would be fun. I didn’t think that your lifestyle really allowed you to be the kind of fun that I like. I want to go dance with my friends at The Dime. I just thought that you’d be like, ‘Oh no, that’s of the world,’” she shared on the podcast, to which he replied, "&nbsp;actually wanted someone who understood that my whole life wasn’t lived in a sanctuary. Somebody who could let me access that side of me without feeling judged. So, meeting you helped me to actually be balanced and be ok with balance.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>Shaunie was married to her ex-husband Shaquille O'Neal from 2002 to 2011. The duo shares four children — Amirah, Shaquir, Shareef, and Me'arah. She also has a son, Miles, from a previous relationship. Shaunie and Shaq also have a cordial relationship because of their children. Shaq was also present at Shaunie's<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> wedding</a> to Keion, which took place in May 2022.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnm5q2sLqMoZynnJWnwLC6jLCgn51dmsOmutOsZJ2hpqS%2FpLGNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./myles-sanderson.html>&#171;&nbsp;Myles Sanderson- Wiki, Age, Wife, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</a>
